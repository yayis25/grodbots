Build circuits from logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR) in a visual editor.  If you build your circuit properly, the robot will reach the cake, and everyone will be happy!

In addition to the super-fun built in levels, there is a GUI level editor that you can use to build your own set of levels, and have fun stumping your friends and enemies.
